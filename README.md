# Digit-Classifier
This project is a browser-based handwritten digit classifier built using a neural network. The model is trained offline in Python using the MNIST dataset and implemented from scratch with NumPy. After training, the networkâ€™s weights and biases are exported and used by the front end, which reconstructs and runs the neural network directly in the browser using TypeScript.
